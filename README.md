## How to play

### Basics

The numbers tell you the group of consecutive, solid color squares, separated by one or more white squares.

At the top left of the page you can see two modes:

* Pencil mode is used to fill or erase a square
* X mode is used to denote no fill for a square

Simply click a painted square to fill, x, or erase a square.

## To Do

* Add highlight to vertical header
* Alert the user when a puzzle is solved
* Add puzzles and a browser to choose from them
* Consider adding better mobile support when painting multiple squares
